## Homework 7 & 8: LINQ and Extension Methods
## Intro
ToDo: add

### Task
1) Create an extension method to shuffle elements inside a collection.  
2) Make your own LINQ method! Create a method SnapFingers which works like LINQ methods, 
takes a predicate and removes exactly half of all the elements in the collection.
If it's not even number, it should remove 1 less.  
For example:  
if it's 2, it removes 1;  
if it's 4, it removes 2;  
but if it's 3, it removes 1.  
3) Create any collection of any elements you want and do a demo for LINQ:  
Any
Count
Order
Select
Sets
Union
Intersection
Subtraction
