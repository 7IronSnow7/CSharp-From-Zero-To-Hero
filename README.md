# C#: From Zero To Hero

## Task

The year is 2999 and you are in charge of a bar that is completely run by robots.
The bar is actually full of old and new robots: stationary and mobile robots.

Only mobile robots can serve the customers.
Only some mobile robots can make cocktails.
Only some stationary robots can make cocktails.

Robots that are stationary are called MKI.
Robots that are mobile but cannot make milkshakes are called MKII.
Robots that can both move and make milkshakes are called MKIII.

The devices that enable such behavior are: shaker and motor.

### Part 1

Simulate the scenario of mobile and stationary robots serving the customers, who want to order a cocktail.
Implement it in such a way, that the amount of busy stationary robots is at maximum.
A busy robot is considered one that is either taking an order ot making a milkshake.

### Part 2

The best kind of cocktails are still ones made by human.
The bar hired a few people who are supposed to make cocktails.
However, they don't know any recipes.
Only robots know the recipes.
If a human needs to make a cocktail they have not yet made, they will look it up at the nearest robot.
Every milkshake has its' own set of instructions (actions) that need to be executed for a milkshake to be properly made.

Add people to milkshake makers and make sure they learn from the robots and make milkshakes.
