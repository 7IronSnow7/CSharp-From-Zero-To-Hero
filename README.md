## Chapter 4: Testing
### Lesson 3: TDD

#### Intro
Having a double check that our code works is important. If we do have a realisation that we are going to write tests, can we make it more structured?
Is it possible to have a development process, driven by tests?
TDD is not just writing tests. TDD is writing tests first and letting that drive the design of our code.
Red-green-refactoring is writing test first, running code, failing code, implementing code, passing tests, refactoring...
It's time to practice!

#### Task
